# VIP Admin 📱🔐

An Android application experiment exploring **time-based access control**, **secure file handling**, and **dynamic code loading**.  
This project was built to study concepts in **application security, protection, and controlled access** on Android.

---

## ✨ Features
- ⏳ **Time-based access control** using login tokens  
- 🔑 Secure download, extraction, and local storage of files  
- ⚙️ Experimented with **remote code execution** and **dynamic loading** to simulate advanced app protection strategies  
- 📂 Gradle-based Android project structure  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java / Kotlin (Android Studio project)  
- **Build System**: Gradle  
- **Security Concepts**:
  - Token-based authentication  
  - Encrypted file handling  
  - Runtime class loading
